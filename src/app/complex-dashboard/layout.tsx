   * ! Parallel Routes
   * Parallel routes in nextjs are defined using a feature known as slots.
   * Slots help structure our content in a modular fashion.
   * To define a slot, we use the @folder naming convention.
   * Each slot is then passed as a prop to its corresponding layout.tsx file.
   * 
   * ! Benefits of Parallel Routing
   * ? Independent Route Handling
   * Each slot of your layout, can have its own loading or error states.
   * Beneficial in scenarios where different sections of the page load at varying speeds or encounter unique errors.
   * Only the the error section will be affected and not the entire page.
   * ? Sub-navigation in routes
   * each slot can essentially function as a mini-application, complete with its own navigation and state management.
   * Useful where different sections serve distinct purposes.
   * Each slot can operate standalone entity without affecting the state or display of other sections.
